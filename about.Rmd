I am Phu Sakulwongtana, from Thailand. Right now, I am second year computer science student at University College London.

I am mainly interested in 

  * Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  
    * Theory of Mind 
    * Emergence of Langauges 
    
  * Graph Neural Network
  
    * Relational Reasoning 
    
  * Meta-Learning
  * Model-Based
  * Unsupervised Learing 

In order to apply to __Reinforcement Learning__ in order to improves generalization. I am also interested in related fields (and why I really enjoy doing AI/ML/DL) such as 

  * Game Theory/Mechanism Design
  * Behavior Economics
  * Neuroeconomics 
  * Physics
  
    * Statistical Mechanics 
    * General Relativity (My childhood dream)
    * Quantum Mechanics 
    
  * Neuroscience -- espiecialy __System__ Neuroscience
  
Right now, I am adding my olds notes from courses, that I have taken from free couses avaliable in the internet, into this website (also refresh some of memories), and will continue doing it. 

100% of the courses I took (that are not university courses) is freely avaliable online.
