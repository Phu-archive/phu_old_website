## Seperation Properties 

__Definition__ -- Topological Space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O})
$$

is called T1 if any 2 distict points, 

$$
p \ne q, \exists \mathcal{U} \in \mathcal{O} : p \in \mathcal{U} \wedge q \not\in \mathcal{U}
$$

__Definition__ -- Topological Space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O})
$$

is called T2 (Hausdorff) if for 2 distinct points, 

$$
p \ne q , \exists \mathcal{U} \in \mathcal{O} , \mathcal{V} \in \mathcal{O} : p \in \mathcal{U} , q \in \mathcal{V} : \mathcal{U} \cap V = \emptyset
$$

Intuitively, we can visualized it as. 

```{r fig.cap="Diagram for T1 and T2 in order", layout="l-body-outset"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Figure1.png")

```

__Example__ -- For

$$
(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathcal{O}_{\text{standard } \mathbb{R}^d})
$$

is T2, which implies T1. while, Zariski-Topology (algebraic geometry) is T1 but not T2, and For 

$$
\left(M, \{M, \emptyset\} \right)
$$

is T2 and not even T1.

## Compactness & Para-Compactness 

__Definition__ -- A topological space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O})
$$

is called compact if every open-cover $C$ are a finite sub-cover. 

__Definition__ -- Open Cover 

$$
C \subseteq \mathcal{O} \text{ is open cover if } \bigcup C = M 
$$

__Definition__ -- Finite Sub-Cover is a cover such that 

$$
\tilde{C} \subseteq C
$$

and it is finite. 

__Definition__ -- A subset $N \subseteq M$ is called compact if 

$$
(N, \mathcal{O}|_N)
$$

is compact. 

__Theorem (Heine-Borel)__ -- In a metric space 

$$
(M, d)
$$

Equipped with the metric induced topology. Every closed and bounded subset is compact. 

__Definition__ -- Metric is a map 

$$
d : M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+
$$

such that

$$
\begin{aligned} d(m,n) &= d(n,m) \\ d(m, n) &\ge 0 \\ d(a, b) + d(b, c) &\ge d(a, c)  \end{aligned}
$$


__Definition__ -- Metric induced topology, similar defined as standard topology, but 

$$
B_r(p) = \left\{ q | d(p, q) < r \right\}
$$

__Example__ 

1. This is compact 

$$
[0, 1]
$$

2. The real line is not compact  $\mathbb{R}$.

<aside>
 We can construct a cover that has not finite sub-covers.
where if you can't take any sub-cover out without 
</aside>

__Theorem__ -- For 2 topological spaces 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O}_M) , (N, \mathcal{O}_N)
$$

are topological space. Then, 

$$
(M \times N, \mathcal{O}_{M \times N})
$$

is also compact. 

### Paracompact 

__Definition__ -- A topological space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O}_M)
$$

is called paracompact if every open-cover $C$ has an open refinement $\tilde{C}$ that is locally finite. 

__Definition__ -- Open Refinement is an open-cover such that 

$$
\forall \mathcal{U} \in C : \exists \tilde{\mathcal{U}} \in \tilde{C} : \tilde{\mathcal{U}} \subseteq \mathcal{U}
$$

__Definition__ -- Locally finite 

$$
\forall p \in M : \exists \mathcal{U} \in \mathcal{O} \text{ such that } \mathcal{U} \cap \tilde{\mathcal{U}} \ne \emptyset
$$

only for finitely many 

$$
\tilde{\mathcal{U}} \in \tilde{C}
$$

__Corollary__ -- Compact implies Paracompact. 

__Theorem__ -- Every metricable topology is paramcompact. For example, 

$$
(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{O}_{\text{st}})
$$

Alexandrov long line (not paracompact). The idea is that 

$$
\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Z} \times [0, 1)
$$
This is paracompact. However, for a long line, 

$$
L = w_1 \times [0, 1) \text{ where } w \text{ is no countable set.}
$$

is not paracompact. 

__Theorem__ -- if 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O}_M)
$$

is paracompact and 

$$
(N, \mathcal{O}_N)
$$

is compact, then 

$$
(M \times N, \mathcal{O}_{M \times N})
$$

is paracompact. 

__Corollary__ -- We can use that to contruct a paracompact topology.

$$
\underbrace{M \times \underbrace{N_1 \times N_2 \times ... \times N_f}_{\text{Compact}}}_{\text{Paracompact}}
$$

__Theorem__ -- Let 

$$
(M , \mathcal{O})
$$

Be Hausdorff topological space. Then it is paracompact if and only if every open cover admits a partition of unity subordinate to that cover. 

__Definition__ -- Partition of unity is a set $F$ of continuous function. 

$$
f \in \mathcal{F} : M \rightarrow [0, 1]
$$

where $[0, 1]$ is induced topology from real line such that 

  1. For Every function $f$ in the set 
  
$$
\exists \mathcal{U} \in C : f(p)\ne 0 \implies p \in \mathcal{U}
$$
  2. For all points in set $M$. There exists an open neighborhood 
  
$$
V \text{ where } p \in V \text{ and } V \in \mathcal{O}
$$
such that only finitely many function are non-zero on V 

$$
\sum^N_{n=1}f_n = 1
$$

## Connectedness

__Definition__ -- A topological space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O}_M)
$$

is called connected, unless there exists 2 non-empty, non-intersecting open set $A$ and $B$ such that 

$$
M = A \cup B
$$


__Example__ -- The topology isn't connnected because 

$$
(\mathbb{R} \backslash 0, \mathcal{O}_{\text{st}} |_{\mathbb{R} \backslash 0 })
$$

because we can find $A$ and $B$ which are 

$$
A = (-\infty, 0) \text{ and } B = (0, \infty)
$$
__Theorem__ -- $[0, 1]$ is connected. 

__Theorem__ -- A topological space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O})
$$

is connected if and only if 

$$
\emptyset, M
$$

are only subset that are both open and closed. 

__Proof__ 

Forward Implication -- Proof by contradiction. Suppose there is another 

$$
\mathcal{U} \subseteq M
$$

That is open and closed at the same time, then 

$$
M = \mathcal{U} \cup (M \backslash \mathcal{U})
$$

and Hense $M$ isn't connected 

Backward Implication -- Suppose M isn't connected. Then there exists non-empty, non-intersecting $A$ and $B$ such that 

$$
M = A \cup B = A \cup (M \backslash A)
$$

and we just show that A is closed and open. 

__Definition__ -- The topological space 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O})
$$

is called path connected if for every pairs of points $p, q \in M$, There exists a continuous curve 

$$
\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow M
$$

such that 

$$
\gamma (0) = p \text{ and } \gamma(1) = q
$$

__Example__ -- The topological space 

$$
(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathcal{O}_{\text{Standard}}) 
$$

is path connected. Proof by define a curve 

$$
\gamma(\lambda) = p + \lambda(p -q)
$$

__Theorem__ -- Path connected implies that it is connected 

__Proof__ -- We proof by contradiction, suppose 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O}_M)
$$

is a path connected without being connect. Then there exists non-empty, non-intersecting open set $A$ and $B$ such that

$$
M = A \cup B
$$

Choose a point $a$ and $b$ in $A$ and $B$. Since the topological space is path connected, there exists a continuous curves 

$$
\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow M \text{ such that } \gamma(0) = a, \gamma(1) = b
$$

Then we can see that 

$$
[0, 1] = \text{pre-im}_{\gamma} (M) = \text{pre-im}_{\gamma}(A \cup B) = \underbrace{\text{pre-im}_{\gamma}(A)}_{\text{Open Non-Empty}} \cup \underbrace{\text{pre-im}_{\gamma}(B)}_{\text{Open Non-Empty}}
$$

Then $[0, 1]$ is not connected (Which is not correct).

## Homotopic Curves 

__Definition__ -- 2 Curves 

$$
\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow M \text{ and } \delta : [0, 1] \rightarrow M \text{ where } \gamma(0) = \delta(0) \text{ and } \gamma(1) = \delta(1)
$$
Where 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O})
$$

is a topological space. They are called homotopic if there exists a continuous map 

$$
h : [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \rightarrow M
$$

such that 

$$
h(0, \lambda) = \gamma(\lambda) \text{ and } h(1, \lambda) = \delta(\gamma) , \lambda \in [0, 1]
$$

For example,

```{r fig.cap="Diagram example", layout="l-body-outset"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Figure2.png")

```

Where the example can be 

$$
h(0.5, \cdot)
$$

Homotopic is an equivalent relation. 

__Definition__ -- Let 

$$
(M, \mathcal{O}) 
$$

be a topological space. Then for every point $M$ define a space of loops at point p as 

$$
\mathcal{L}_p = \left\{ \gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow M | \gamma \text{ continuous }, \gamma(0) = \gamma(1) \right\}
$$

__Definition__ -- Let an operator be 

$$
*_p : \mathcal{L}_p \times \mathcal{L}_P \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_p
$$

for $\lambda$ be an interval $[0, 1]$ be 

$$
(\gamma * \delta)(\lambda) = \begin{cases} \gamma(2\lambda) &\text{for } 0 \le \lambda < \frac{1}{2} \\ \delta(2\lambda -1) &\text{for } \frac{1}{2} \le\lambda < 1 \end{cases}
$$

We call it concatenation. 

### Fundamental Group 

The fundamental group 

$$
(\pi_{1_p}, \cdot )
$$

of a topological space is the set 

$$
\pi_{1_p} = \mathcal{L}_p / \sim(\text{homotopy}) = \{[\gamma] | \gamma \in \mathcal{L}_p\}
$$

Together with a map 

$$
\cdot : \pi_{1_p} \times \pi_{1_p} \rightarrow \pi_{1_p}
$$

be 

$$
[\gamma] \cdot [\delta] = [\gamma * \delta]
$$

And it 

* is Associative 
* has identity as 

$$
\gamma_{\text{id}, p} : [0, 1] \rightarrow M \quad \gamma(\lambda) = p
$$

* The inverse is when running backward.

__Example__ 

* $S^2$ is a sphere where all the loops are homotopic 

$$
\pi_1 = \{[\gamma_{\text{id}, p}]\}
$$

* $T^2$ be a torus, where it is the same as, where there are 2 "types" of loop that can be looped around the shape.

$$
T^2 = S^2 \times S^2
$$



* $C$ is a tube, where there are arbitrary number of loops wrapped around the shape.

$$
C = \mathbb{R} \times S^1
$$

we can see that (if we "count" the number of times a path is wrapped around), we can see that 

$$
(\pi_1, \cdot ) \cong_{\text{group}} (\mathbb{Z}, +)
$$

meaning that there is a bijection 

$$
f : \pi_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } f(\alpha \cdot \beta) = f(\alpha) + f(\beta)
$$
